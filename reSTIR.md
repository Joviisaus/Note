Few research about light sampling,[[Dynamic Many-Light Sampling for Real-Time Ray Tracing.]] offers a example

[[Spatiotemporal reservoir resampling for real-time ray tracing with dynamic direct lighting]] introduced reSTIR to use Monte Carlo method and upgrade the sampling strategy , A sample and denoising pipeline is built.
