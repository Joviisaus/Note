# Polynomial 2D Biharmonic Coordinates for  High-order Cages

## Cage coordinates
1. interpolate an arbitrary point through a weighted combination of these values(MVC)
2. control over boundary values and boundary derivatives(PolyGC)

### Boundary element method
1. The differential equation within the domain is converted into an integral equation on the boundary. 
2. The boundary is then discretized into finite-sized boundary elements. 
3. The boundary integral equation is transformed into an algebraic equation. 
4. Solving the algebraic equation to obtain the solution of the original partial differential equation.
